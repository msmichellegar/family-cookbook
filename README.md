# The Barron Family Cookbook

A holiday project, digitising my extended family's recipes. Up until now, my family's recipes have existed as a PDF that my Aunt put together as a Christmas gift several years ago. I'm now putting these recipes online so they're more easily-accessible for those who want to cook my mother's lasagne.

## What is this built in?

I'm using run-of-the-mill SASS on the frontend, Node.js on the backend, and a Redis database. Even a few tests in Tape since I know my Grandma will be devastated if the site goes down.

## Features

* A gallery of recipes to choose from, with a thumbnail photo for each
* Clickthrough from the gallery to a dedicated page for each recipe
* Ability for anyone to add new recipes to the site

Stretch goals:
* Before adding or editing a recipe, users have to first prove they're a Barron by passing family trivia questions
* Able to leave comments or reviews on recipes, or say it has been cooked
* Sort recipes by number of times cooked or rating

Version 1.0 is now live! Check it out at [BarronFamilyCookbook.com](www.barronfamilycookbook.com).
