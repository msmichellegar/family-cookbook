# The Barron Family Cookbook

A holiday project, digitising my extended family's recipes. Up until now, my family's recipes have existed as a PDF that my Aunt put together as a Christmas gift several years ago. I'm now putting these recipes online so they're more easily-accessible for those who want to cook my mother's lasagne.

## What is this built in?

I'm using run-of-the-mill SASS on the frontend, Node.js on the backend, and a Redis database. Maybe even some tests in Tape since I know my Grandma will be devastated if the site goes down.

## Features

* A gallery of recipes to choose from, with a thumbnail photo for each
* Clickthrough from the gallery to a dedicated page for each recipe

Stretch goals:
* Ability for anyone to add new recipes to the site
* Able to leave comments or reviews on recipes, or say it has been cooked
* Sort recipes by number of times cooked or rating

## Timeline

I'm going to hack this out over Christmas and see what happens.
